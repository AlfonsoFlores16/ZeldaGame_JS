# Zelda-like Game

## This game is implemented using HTML and JavaScript. It implements OOP concepts as well as object collision. 

### Future updates to this game will include a timer and a score tracker. Additionally, I hope to add new features such as character selection and coin animations.

### HOW TO RUN: Download all the files in this repository to your computer and open the 'Game.html' file with a browser.
